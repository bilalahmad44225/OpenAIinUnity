# OpenAIinUnity
This repository contains a Unity project that integrates the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model to create a chatbot-like experience within a Unity application. With this project, you can build interactive conversational interfaces in your Unity projects using the power of ChatGPT.

Features
Send user queries to the ChatGPT model and receive human-like responses.
Customize the behavior of the chatbot by adjusting parameters like temperature.
Display chat responses in Unity UI components.
Create and modify objects within the Unity scene based on chat responses.
Create and modify scripts within the Unity project based on chat responses.
Getting Started
To get started with the ChatGPT and Unity project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Unity.
Set up your OpenAI API key. Replace the apiKey variable in the ChatGPTQueryEditor.cs script with your own API key.
Create UI elements in Unity to capture user input and display chat responses.
Build and run the project in the Unity Editor or export it to your desired platform.
Usage
Run the Unity project.
Enter a user query in the provided UI input field.
Click the "Send Request" button to send the query to the OpenAI ChatGPT model.
The chat response from the model will be displayed in the UI component.
Based on the response, objects can be created or modified within the Unity scene.
